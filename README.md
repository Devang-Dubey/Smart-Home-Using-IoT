# Smart-Home-Using-IoT
The overall design of a Smart Home with a low-cost and wireless technology
is presented in this project. It focuses on the creation of an IoT-based home automation
system that can control multiple components over the internet or be automatically
programmed to work based on environmental circumstances. In this project, we will
create a firmware for smart control that can be successfully automated while minimizing
human contact in order to maintain the integrity of entire electrical gadgets in the home.
To automate the process, we used Node MCU, a popular open source IOT platform.
Different transmission modes will be used by different components of the system to
send the user's control of the devices to the actual appliance via Node MCU. Wireless
technology is used in the main control system to provide remote access from a
smartphone. We're leveraging cloud server-based connectivity, which will make the idea
more realistic by allowing users free access to the appliances. To improve automation,
we provided a data transmission network.
